# Smart-Traffic-Lights
Smarter, cheaper traffic lights utilizing existing or installing traffic cameras equipped with Tensorflow to control traffic patterns on a Neural Network.

Our system will use 360 degree cameras (or a group of cameras in view of all lanes) placed at intersections to livestream traffic feeds to the program. Using Tensorflow for fast image recognition, we will track vehicles in real-time to collect traffic data. By collecting data from near-by intersections, we can use decision making algorithms to minimize total time spent waiting at traffic lights.
